## Folder Architecture

1. **assets**: Contains static assets like images and svg that are used throughout the application.

2. **components**: Holds reusable components. Each component has its own folder with files for the component (Component.js), styles (Component.css)

3. **containers**: Higher-level components representing different pages or major sections of your application. Each container has its own folder similar to components.

4. **context**: Contains files related to React Context. For example, AuthContext.js might include the context for managing authentication state using the createContext API.

5. **services**: Utility functions or modules that interact with external services, such as API calls.

6. **utils**: General utility functions and helpers used across the application.# version-24-frontend
